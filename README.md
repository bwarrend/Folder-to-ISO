GUI interface for mkisofs.  Makes it much easier to create an ISO from a folder in Windows.

Release:
https://github.com/bwarrend/Folder-to-ISO/raw/master/Release/FolderToISO.zip

Issues Found: If you click in the CMD window you will enter Select mode, the process will halt and not create the ISO while in this mode.  You can simply press the Enter key while the CMD window is selected.  The process should then continue.
